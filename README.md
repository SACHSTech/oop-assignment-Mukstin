*Insert Class Diagram here*  

## Summary
This class diagram represents an online retailer with the variety of items in stock. It allows the user to shop online and will be able to see the cost at the end. It starts off with the user choosing which category you would like to explore, after the user is brought into the category of their choosing, the user will get to choose from different items. Example if you choose the "Food" category, it will bring you into that category and will give you options of pizza, ice Cream, or bacon. This process will keep going until the user types the word "Confirm". At the end the program will show you your Total, SubTotal, and Tax. The different objects are important because it's the whole purpose of the online retailer, to buy items. The relationship the objects have is an aggregation relationship because if you look at each category, each eletronic product is made up of wires, plastic, etc, same with the gift cards, each one is made out of plastic.
